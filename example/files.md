# Files

This quickly explains how to work with files in GitHub using only the website UI

## Creating files

Creating a file is simple, as seen below. If making a boss guide, use file extends **.md** so for example **Ulgrax.md** so it gets markdown formatting in it. If storing a healer note, you can use **.md** or **.txt**, depending if you care about anything but the note or not

## Uploading files

If you have an existing file you want to upload, you can do that too

## Editing files

Simply click the little pencil icon in the top right of the file viewer, and it will open the file editor. Use the "Commit changes" button to save.

## Uploading MP4s directly

Don't try to use image link syntax, GitHub only in-lines files directly uploaded to their special domain.

## Linking to a file

If you want to link directly to a boss MD for example, use the **"Copy permalink"** option in the (...) menu
